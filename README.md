## Cloudfoundry:

I am using Pivotal Cloudfoundry: https://run.pivotal.io/

With the official CLI: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html#pkg-linux

Here is a nice upload overview: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html

## Serverless Single Page Apps:

I am roughly following the steps from the book "Serverless Single Page Apps".

# Steps
## Step 1
Created a simple html site and loaded it up. The needed buildpack is "staticfile_buildpack"

## Step 2
Copied the testing environment from leanjs including the libs for Jasmine and jQuery. 
For it all to work some <script src...> tags need to be added to main html site.
Added Hashtag-Routing as described in the book to:
- Learn Jasmine unit testing
- Learn about Jasmine spyOn
- Learn a bit of jQuery
  
Deployed again

## Step 3
Messed around with styles and CSS. 
Took a bit from this tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/Css/
And of course from http://www.csszengarden.com/.
